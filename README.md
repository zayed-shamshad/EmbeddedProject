# Image Classification Android App

This Android app utilizes machine learning (ML) models and TensorFlow Lite to classify images using different ML models. The app intelligently switches between various models based on the available resources, specifically the device's RAM, to ensure optimal performance. The app is developed using Java and ML Kit for image classification.

## Features

- Image Classification: Users can capture or select images from their device's gallery for classification.
- ML Model Selection: The app dynamically selects the appropriate ML model based on the device's RAM availability.
- TensorFlow Lite Integration: TensorFlow Lite is used to run the ML models efficiently on mobile devices.
- Real-Time Classification: The app provides real-time classification of images, displaying the predicted labels or categories.
- Model Management: The app allows users to manage and update the ML models used for image classification.

## Technologies Used

- Programming Language: Java
- ML Library: TensorFlow Lite
- Android Development: Android Studio, Android SDK
- ML Model Training: TensorFlow or any other compatible ML framework

## Installation and Setup

1. Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/image-classification-android-app.git
```

2. Open the project in Android Studio.

3. Make sure you have the necessary dependencies and SDKs installed.

4. Build and run the app on your Android device or emulator.

## Usage

1. Launch the app on your Android device.
2. Capture an image using the device's camera or select an image from the gallery.
3. The app will automatically classify the image using the ML model selected based on RAM availability.
4. View the predicted labels or categories for the image.
5. Repeat the process for additional images.
6. Users can manage and update the ML models used for image classification within the app.
